### Flora - Slime Molds

Slime mold exhibits a range of intelligent behaviors - including a fractal pathfinding behavior it uses to seek out food. The mold sends out vein-like envoys that explore an environment - when food is located, all non-pertinent paths are retracted.

The behavior was observed in a 2012 study to be robust enough to not only solve mazes, but also find the most efficient route through them.

Here, the behavior is emulated in a compute shader.
